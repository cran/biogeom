\details{
The estimated values of the parameters using the \code{\link{lmTE}} function tend to be NOT globally optimal, and the values 
are only used as the initial values for using the \code{\link{fitETE}} function. 
There are two methods to obtain the major axis (i.e., the mid-line) of an egg's profile: the maximum distance method, and 
the longest axis adjustment method. In the first method, the straight line through two points forming the maximum distance 
on the egg's boundary is defined as the major axis. In the second method, we assume that there is an angle 
of deviation for the longest axis (i.e., the axis associated with the maximum distance between two points on an egg's profile) 
from the mid-line of the egg's profile. That is to say, 
the mid-line of an egg's profile is not the axis associated with the maximum distance between two points on the egg's profile. 
When \code{dev.angle = NULL}, the maximum distance method is used; when \code{dev.angle} is a numerical value or a numerical vector, 
the longest axis adjustment method is used. Here, the numerical value of \code{dev.angle} is not 
the angle of deviation for the major axis of an egg's profile from the \eqn{x}-axis, and instead it is the angle of deviation  
for the longest axis (associated with the maximum distance between two points on the egg's profile) from the mid-line of the egg's profile. 
The planar coordinate data of an egg's profile are extracted using the protocols proposed by Shi et al. (2015, 2018) 
(and also see Su et al. (2019)). For the planar coordinate data extracted using the protocols of Shi et al. (2015, 2018), 
the data points are more regularly distributed on the egg's profile (perimeter), 
although the \eqn{x} values of the data points along the mid-line are not equidistant.

  \item{par}{the estimates of the four model parameters in the Troscianko equation.}
  \item{theta}{the angle between the longest axis of an egg's profile (i.e., 
the axis associated with the maximum distance between two points on the egg's profile) and the \eqn{x}-axis.}
  \item{epsilon}{the optimal angle of deviation for the longest axis (associated with the maximum distance between two points on an egg's profile) 
from the mid-line of the egg's profile, when \code{dev.angle} is not \code{NULL}.}
  \item{RSS.vector}{the vector of residual sum of squares corresponding to \code{dev.angle}, when \code{dev.angle} is not \code{NULL}.}

  \item{y.stand.pred}{the predicted \eqn{y} coordinates corresponding to the the observed \eqn{x} coordinates,

  \item{scan.length}{the length of the egg's boundary. The default is the maximum distance between two points on

  \item{scan.perimeter}{the perimeter of the egg's boundary based on all data points on the egg's boundary.}
  \item{RSS.scaled}{the residual sum of squares between the observed and predicted \eqn{y} values for a scaled egg's profile whose length equals 2.}
  \item{RSS}{the residual sum of squares between the observed and predicted \eqn{y} values.}
  \item{sample.size}{the number of data points used in the numerical calculation.}
  \item{RMSE.scaled}{the root-mean-square errors between the observed and predicted \eqn{y} values for a scaled egg's profile whose length equals 2.}      
  \item{RMSE}{the root-mean-square errors between the observed and predicted \eqn{y} values.}       
}
\note{
\code{theta} is the calculated angle between the longest axis (i.e., the axis associated with the maximum distance 
between two points on an egg's profile) and the \eqn{x}-axis, and \code{epsilon} is the calculated angle of deviation for the longest 
axis from the mid-line of the egg's profile. This means that the angle between the mid-line and the \eqn{x}-axis is equal to 
\code{theta} + \code{epsilon}. 
Here, \code{RSS}, and \code{RMSE} are for the observed and predicted \eqn{y} coordinates of the egg's profile, not for those 
when the egg's length is scaled to 2. There are two figures when \code{fig.opt = TRUE}: (i) the observed 
and predicted egg's boundaries when the egg's length is scaled to 2, and (ii) the observed 
and predicted egg's boundaries at their actual scales.
